    Sorry folks, this no longer works:
       - After the latest updates, this does not work anymore. 
       I've attempted to try it with other radar services (skiplag), but my efforts availed to nothing.
       For now I will keep this up in hopes that maybe one day an open API will be available and I
       can revive this.

`pokemon-go-slack-radar` is a simple slash command that allows you to scan for nearby pokemon based on a selected address every X seconds for X minutes.
